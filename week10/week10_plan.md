Web Development with Ruby on Rails

#Week 10

##Overview 

This week we turn to Rails and start preparing for capstone.

## Topics

0. Code Challenge 08 team presentations
1. Rails - we start with self-study with a short Rails tutorial and some screencasts.
2. Specifying a web application - We went over the "elevator pitch" last week. This week we introduce "user stories", the design brief, and review wireframes and page flow diagrams. The concepts are summarized in [a short article](../articles/user_stories_wireframes_page_flows.md)
3. Capstone kickoff -- We discuss [the process](../capstone/capstone_plan.md) and set some dates.

## Assignment

Each student is responsible for accomplishing these assignments as individuals. That said, forming study groups for tutorials is an extremely good idea.

1. Complete the [Kehoe Tutorial](http://learn-rails.com/students). This is due next Tuesday. To get a copy, go to http://learn-rails.com/students and use the invitation code “PORTLANDCODE”. Do not give this code to anybody outside our class.
2. Start the following CodeSchool.com screencasts and go as far as you can before next Tuesday. We'll compare velocities in class and calibrate the rest of the course together:
  0. [Rails for Zombies Redux](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-redux)
  0. [Rails for Zombies 2](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-for-zombies-2)
  0. [Rails 4: Zombie Outlaws](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/rails-4-zombie-outlaws)
3. Read the [introductory "Getting Started" Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)

Note! The various tutorials and screencasts use different versions of Rails (mostly 3.2 vs 4.0). So will your employers. Pay attention!
