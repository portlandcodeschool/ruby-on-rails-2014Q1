Note: Saturday class!! We will have additional class time from 9-4pm on Saturday. presentations & discussions from 9 to 12, lunch, then open lab time from 1 to 4. 

###This week you will:

0. Track and report your "billable hours" - the time you actually spend on performing PCS learning activities. Do not report any time you spend learning related topics, using related sources, or spending time with other coders that you do not use to work on class work. You should include the time you spend at Tuesday's meetup and Friday's happy hour, be cause those are required and/or recommended by PCS. Report for the period of Monday through Monday.



0. Continue the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com)

0. Finish the  [CodeSchool.com Testing with RSpec course](http://rspec.codeschool.com)

0. Read and watch the topic information you will need for the code challenge (See below)

0. Do [the third code challenge](../code_challenge_03/README.md) in pairs in class and outside of class. 

0. Do [the fourth code challenge](../code_challenge_04/README.md) in pairs in class and outside of class. Pairs will be assigned and the code challenge will be put up by Thursday night.

0. Start using [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) for all code challenges and class projects.  See also this [helpful blog post](http://blog.crowdint.com/2013/11/29/improve-your-ruby-syntax-with-rubocop.html).  Starting with Code Challenge 04, you will be required to either have zero offenses or be able to rationally defend your choices when you chose to ignore them. Your instructor will use vanilla Rubocop with no overrides when evaluating your code. 

0. Review ["Rules for Developers" by Sandi Metz](http://robots.thoughtbot.com/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers) - a small set of ideas to make you think a certain way about your coding style and to make your object-oriented Ruby code smaller, clearer, and easier to maintain. 

0. Code walk throughs on Saturday. Presentation elements will include:
	* the purpose of the code
	* inputs
	* processing, with major methods and data structures
	* outputs
	* tests
	* style guide "offenses" and rationale
