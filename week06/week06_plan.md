*Portland Code School*

Web Development with Ruby on Rails

#Week 6

##Activities
* Self-assessment discussion
* Fifth code challenge
* Introduction to Databases and Data modelling

###This week you will:

0. Continue to track and report your "billable hours" - the time you actually spend on performing PCS learning activities. Do not report any time you spend learning related topics, using related sources, or spending time with other coders that you do not use to work on class work. You should include the time you spend at Tuesday's Hack & Help and Friday's happy hour, because those are required and/or recommended by PCS. Report for the period of Monday through Monday.

0. Estimate with your partner the time it will take to complete the current code challenge, report it to your instructor, then report how much time it actually took when you are complete.

0. Continue the [Ruby Koans](http://rubykoans.com). You should be getting ready to finish.

0. Finish the  [CodeSchool.com Testing with RSpec course](http://rspec.codeschool.com)

0. Read and watch the topic information you will need for the code challenge (See below)

0. Continue using [Rubocop](https://github.com/bbatsov/rubocop) for all code challenges and class projects.  See also this [helpful blog post](http://blog.crowdint.com/2013/11/29/improve-your-ruby-syntax-with-rubocop.html).  Starting with Code Challenge 04, you will be required to either have zero offenses or be able to rationally defend your choices when you chose to ignore them. Your instructor will use vanilla Rubocop with no overrides when evaluating your code. 

0. Discuss data modeling


The data modeling presentation doesn't print well due to the animations. You can see a series of (slower, captioned) screencasts that I did for Portland Community College using the same presentation materials here:

* [Intro to Databases 1 Overview ](http://youtu.be/D98mNPLccSg)
* [Intro to Databases 2 Queries, Forms, Reports, Pages & APIs](http://youtu.be/8UGE0ec-xdo)
* [Intro to Databases 3 Development Process](http://youtu.be/mLWZ2Y10pBA)
* [Intro to Databases 4 Schema](http://youtu.be/W5Xv6CEvC2E)
